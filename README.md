# OpenShift Basics Lab

Welcome to the "OpenShift Basics" Lab!

Please complete the `prerequisites/` before beginning the `lab/` if you do not already have an OpenShift 3.11 cluster. In the prereq you will install Minishift, which we'll use in the `lab/` to deploy an application on OpenShift.

Once you have an OpenShift 3.11 running, either through Minishift or existing, complete the `lab/`, where you'll get some hands-on experience with OpenShift and learn about some of its cool features.

Please don't hesitate to reach out for any questions!
